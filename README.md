## Decription
This is one of three projects of Computer Network course - Ho Chi Minh University of Science. Our target were creating a client - server application to update gold rate of brands which is in Viet Nam everyday.  
In this project, we mainly used *socket programming* technique to communicate between clients computers and server which knowledge we had learned in Computer Network course. Besides, we used some tools for other tasks (e.g. `Beautifulsoup`, `request` and `urlib` for crawling gold data; `tkinter`, `PIL` for GUI; and MySQL database for storing and querying data)

## Running
### server.py
To run this file, beside installing all of libraries we used in this file you have to have initialized mySQL database. Then, you will modify parameters `host`, `user` and `password` at 446th line in this file

### client.py
You just execute it more easilier than server.py with installed necessary libraries, obviously!
